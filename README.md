# PPO Sandbox & Experiments

## Getting started

PPO sandbox uses poetry for python package management. Installation instructions can be found at https://python-poetry.org/docs/

Then install packages and run:

```
poetry install
poetry run python ppo_from_scratch.py
```

Many parameters are configurable from the command line. For an overview, see:

```
poetry run python ppo_from_scratch.py --help
```
